  designation for applications that function to store usernames and passwords
  for various websites or applications. Password manager is designation for
  applications that function to store usernames and passwords for various
  websites or applications. Simple Password Manager provides a simple option for
  managing your passwords locally. This task is not too difficult to do. But i
  still need a direction from my teacher to do it.  We only have to create codes
  whose function is to enter and store passwords.


  Pickle is a standard Python library for serializing and deserializing Python objects to and from binary data streams.


  So this is my write up task about Simple Password manager:
---
import pickle

def main():
    berangkas = {}
    while True:
        # Prompt the user to choose an action (add a password, retrieve a password, or exit the program)

```

```

if *name* == '*main*':
    main()
