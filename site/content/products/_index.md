intro:
  heading: Levels and each difficulties
  description: 'About my journey in learning Python and Cybersecurity, i started
    by learning Python first. In Python, we will learn the basics of coding. For
    example, how to make an object in our computer. After that we will move to
    the next level, for example: How to make a simple video game. And then we
    will move to the "Cybersecurity". In Cybersecurity lesson we will learn how
    to install security in our server.'

  heading: Is Cybersecurity difficult?
  description: Of course, each level has its own difficulties. And of course there
    are levels that are very difficult in our opinion, so we need more guidance.
    Don't be afraid to ask your tutor. Because if we understand how to do it,
    then our knowledge of programming will increase. With more knowledge, we
    will become increasingly aware of ways to overcome problems that exist in
    programming. So when you find it difficult to solve a problem, the solution
    is to ask someone who knows better/your teacher
